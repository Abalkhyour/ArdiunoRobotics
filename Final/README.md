Brief conceptual description:

As an architecture Student, i have been working with more static models and structures. thus taking this oppurtunity to work 
and develop more dynamic structures. the goal of this project to create this minor illusion of the helix rotating in one 
direction while the whole strcuture rotating simultaneously as well as being as close to user defined as possible.
I also attempted to connect the strcuture to ones hand held device to control speed as well having LEDs emit different shades 
of Red, Green and Blue based off the speed of the rotations.


Detailed technical description:

The project started with a CNC mill of the wooden structure the includes 2 different double helices. proceeding with a laser
cut pedestal attached to a motor for the wooden structure, including ball barrings and a circular trail as a chosen method to 
help soften the rotations.
Using a circular base for the project, I added 2 motors along with wheels to achieve the second rotations a long with the 
wooden strcuture. Along with the base i connected a ring shape around the helices that is help up with 3 translucent columns 
which were placed to emit the light through them.

Issues I faced:
During the execution of the project, I discovered the idea of the ball barrings work best on a flat and leveled surfaces, any 
other surface would tilt the structures weight on one side and would kill the purpose of the soft rotations, a long with using
wood for the project, after the first couple of days, the wood started scratching the ball barrings which 
affected the movement of the ball barrings, should consider using a different material, or even just a smoother material as a 
buffer between the ball barrings and the pedestal.
